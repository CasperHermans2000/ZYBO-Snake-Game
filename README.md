If you want to use the Vitis project, you first need to update the platform.
Open the Vitis project -> Then download the .xsa file -> Right click on the "hdmi_workspace" platform and select "Update Hardware Specifications" -> Now select the .xsa file you just downloaded.
Now you can build the hdmi_workspace platform and build the snake game. Once the builds are done, you can run the program on your hardware.
